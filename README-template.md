### What I learned

Used this section to recap over some of my major learnings while working through this project. Learn more about css grids. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
 *{
        font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif;
    }
    body{
        margin: 0;
        background-color: hsl(204, 43%, 93%);
    }
    .content{
        width: 80%;
        margin-top: 20%;
        margin-left: 25%;
        display:grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    }
    .con1{
        background-color: #fff;
        padding: 10% 10%;
        grid-column: 1 / 3;
    }
    .con1 h2{
        color:hsl(179, 62%, 43%);
    }
    .con1 h4{
        color: hsl(71, 73%, 54%);
    }
    .con1 p{
        color: hsl(218, 22%, 67%); 
    }
}
```


### Continued development
I would love to practice more of css layouts
